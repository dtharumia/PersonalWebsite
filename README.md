# Personal Website for Dharshan Tharumia

I wanted to have another web presence for my work so I decided to apply my front-end development skills to build this website. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 to design the portfolio site. I also setup a CNAME redirect to my custom domain [dharshan.me](https://dharshan.me) with SSL encryption.
